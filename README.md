# Salamander
### The open source and modular Discord management bot

---

## What is Salamander?
Salamander is a generic discord bot writen with the sole purpose of being entirely modular, and a better, more robust alternative to other largely used bots such as Dyno or Carl. Salamander is meant to be self-hosted, because we believe putting the user in control of every aspect, including the actual source code, is not only beneficial to knowledgeable users, but also the end users they are serving.

## What advantages does salamander offer?

Salamander is written from the ground up with modularity in mind, every command being almost entirely contained withing a specific module, and fully configurable. It's also designed with a technologically inclined audience in mind, targeting users that want absolute control over ever aspect, such as configuration, commands, source code, hosting, and advanced features.
